description: |
  This is a simple echo server that redirects received UDP 
  packets after a random amount of time—so packets can
  get reordered or even dropped—.

  Received packets must carry the destination address in
  the first four bytes of the payload and the destination
  port as the fifth and sixth byte. All of them in
  network byte order.
